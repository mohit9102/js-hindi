###################datatype#####################

There are 2 types of datatype
1. Primitive datatype:-
    1.String
    2. Number
    3. Boolean (true / false)
    4. null (iska matlab hai empty or zero nahi hai)
    5. undefined (aapne variable declare kardiya hai but usmein aap kya value dalenge aapne decide nahi kiya hai)
    6. Symbol (kisi bhi value ko unique banane ke liye use kiya jata hai)
    7. BigInt (jo badi values hoti hai oo hum BigInt mein use karte hai)

2. reference datatype (Non Primitive datatype)
    1. Array ( [ ] )
    2. Object ( { } )
    3. Function ( function( ){ } )



##################stack and heap###########
In JavaScript, data types are classified based on memory allocation:

1))Primitive Data Types: These are passed by value and include string, number, boolean, null, undefined, BigInt, and symbol. They are stored in the stack memory.

2)))Reference (Non-Primitive) Data Types: These are passed by reference and include arrays, objects, and functions. They are stored in the heap memory.

*******JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, meaning that you do not need to declare the data type of a variable when defining it. The type is determined at runtime.
